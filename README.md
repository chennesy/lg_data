# Data resources on academic LibGuides

Code used to analyze data collected for a paper (currently being prepared for submission), "Taking count: A computational analysis of data resources on academic LibGuides," by Cody Hennesy, Alicia Kubas, and Jenny McBurney.

The Python notebook includes code that can be used to replicate the study using data available in [DRUM](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/228216). The study collects and analyzes data and statistical resources shared at academic libraries via the LibGuides platform.
